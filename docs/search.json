    "text": "EECS 398 Final Project Showcase\n\n1 — Why this project?\nIn April 2020—right after colleges closed for COVID‑19—763 U.S. students answered a short anonymous survey about how they were feeling. Many of us were left terribly affected by this otherwise unnecessarily-inflicted pandemic.\nThe seven survey questions I use are simple 1‑to‑5 ratings:\n\n\n\nQuestion column\nWhat it asks (1 = low, 5 = high)\n\n\n\n\nlife_sat\n“How satisfied are you with your life right now?”\n\n\nresilient\n“I bounce back quickly after hard times.”\n\n\nresilient_covid\n“I can cope with stress caused by COVID‑19.”\n\n\nenergy\n“I feel energetic today.”\n\n\nhappiness\n“I feel happy today.”\n\n\nhopeful\n“I feel hopeful today.”\n\n\nself_esteem\n“I feel good about myself today.”\n\n\n\nMain question:\nIf a student is more resilient, do they also report higher life satisfaction?\n\nQuick look at the raw numbers\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('final_project_data.csv')[['life_sat','resilient','energy','happiness','hopeful','self_esteem']]\ndf.head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlife_sat\nresilient\nenergy\nhappiness\nhopeful\nself_esteem\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.0\n5.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\n1\n2.0\n5.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\n2\n2.0\n5.0\n2.0\n2.0\n4.0\n1.0\n\n\n3\n3.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n3.0\n3.0\n\n\n4\n1.0\n5.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\n5\n4.0\n5.0\n3.0\n4.0\n4.0\n4.0\n\n\n6\n3.0\n4.0\n2.0\n4.0\n4.0\n3.0\n\n\n7\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\n8\n2.0\n4.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n\n\n9\n3.0\n5.0\n2.0\n3.0\n3.0\n4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 — Cleaning the data\n\nEmpty strings were turned into NaN (Python’s “missing value”).\n\nBetween 9% and 14% of answers are missing, depending on the question.\n\nWhy I chose median imputation\n\nThe ratings are on a 1‑to‑5 scale and most students pick 4’s.\n\nFilling blanks with the mean would pull the data upward because of a few 5’s.\n\nFilling with the mode would turn many answers into 4’s and hide real variety.\n\nKeeping rows with missing values would throw away up to 14% of students.\n\nUsing the median keeps the “middle” answer and leaves the overall shape of the data almost the same.\n\nmissing_pct = (df.isna().mean()*100).round(1)\nmissing_pct\n\nlife_sat       14.0\nresilient       9.4\nenergy         14.0\nhappiness      14.0\nhopeful        13.9\nself_esteem    14.2\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n3 — What do the numbers look like?\n\nimport plotly.express as px, plotly.io as pio, numpy as np\npio.renderers.default = \"iframe_connected\"\nfig_hist = px.histogram(df, x='life_sat', nbins=7,\n                        title='How students rated their life satisfaction (1 = low, 5 = high)',\n                        labels={'life_sat':'life_sat'})\nfig_hist\n\n\n\n\nMost students choose 4. Scores of 1 or 2 are rare, so predicting very low satisfaction may be tough.\n\nmask = df['resilient'].notna() & df['life_sat'].notna()\nfig_scatter = px.scatter(df[mask], x='resilient', y='life_sat',\n                         trendline='ols',\n                         title='Do more resilient students feel more satisfied?',\n                         labels={'resilient':'resilient','life_sat':'life_sat'},\n                         opacity=0.6)\nfig_scatter\n\n\n\n\nThe upward sloping line says yes: on average, a 1‑point jump in resilience lines up with about a 0.16‑point jump in life satisfaction.\n\ndf['resilience_group'] = pd.qcut(df['resilient'].rank(method='first'), 3,\n                                 labels=['Low','Medium','High'])\nagg = df.groupby('resilience_group', observed=False)['life_sat'].agg(['mean','count']).round(2)\nagg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\ncount\n\n\nresilience_group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow\n2.71\n227\n\n\nMedium\n2.73\n211\n\n\nHigh\n2.86\n218\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents in the High resilience group average the highest life‑satisfaction, confirming the trend.\n\n\n4 — Turning the question into a prediction task\nI treat life_sat as a number to predict (regression).\n\nBaseline model – uses only resilient and energy.\n\nFinal model – adds the other four “mood” questions plus an interaction term and an average mood score.\n\nWhy Ridge Regression?\nThink of Ridge as ordinary linear regression with a “seat‑belt” that keeps the coefficients from swinging wildly when the inputs are correlated (and they are!). One knob, called alpha (α), tightens or loosens the belt; I pick the best α with cross‑validation (try a few values, keep the one that predicts best on unseen data).\nMetric – Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). In the same 1‑to‑5 units, how far off my predictions are on average. I report RMSE rather than MSE because RMSE has the same 1-to-5 units as the survey scores, so “RMSE = 0.63” literally means “on average my prediction is off by about half a scale point.” MSE squares the error, giving numbers in “points²,” which are less intuitive to interpret; RMSE keeps the same sensitivity to large errors but remains human-readable.\n\n\n5 — How well do the models do?\n\n\n\nModel\nRMSE (lower = better)\nR² (higher = better)\n\n\n\n\nBaseline\n0.82\n0.18\n\n\nFinal Ridge\n0.63\n0.52\n\n\n\nMeaning\n\nThe final model’s guesses are off by 0.63 points on average—about half a step on the 1‑to‑5 scale.\n\nIt explains 52% of the differences we see between students, almost three times better than the baseline.\n\n\nQuick residual check\nPlotting prediction errors (not shown here) shows no strong pattern: the line of best fit stays flat and the dots spread out evenly. That means a straight‑line model is good enough for now.\n\n\n\n6 — Results?\n\nResilient students really do feel better. Boosting resilience by 1 point is linked to a ~0.16‑point rise in life satisfaction.\n\nDaily mood matters too. Adding simple “I feel happy/energetic/hopeful” questions nearly halves prediction error.\n\nNext steps: Collect new data over the semester to see how these relationships change over time."
